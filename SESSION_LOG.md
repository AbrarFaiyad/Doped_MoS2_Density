# Doped MoS2 Density Project - Session Log

## Project Overview
Starting a new project focused on doped MoS2 density calculations and analysis.

---

## Session Entry: July 14, 2025

### User Prompt:
```
About to start a new project in the Doped_MoS2_density folder

Maintain a session log in a Markdown (.md) file.
For every user prompt, record the exact text of the prompt and your corresponding response.
Document all problems you are instructed to solve, including your thought process, code implementations, iterations, and the final resolution.
Clearly note when a problem has been successfully solved, with confirmation and any relevant details.
Use the session log as your source of memory.
If you lose track of what you were doing, consult the Markdown file and the codebase to reestablish context.
Use the log to understand what approaches have worked and which have not.
Auto-save code periodically using Git.
Commit code at key milestones, including:
Upon solving a problem.
After implementing major features or refactors.
Before any experimental or potentially breaking changes.
Use clear, descriptive commit messages summarizing your actions and intent.
Revert only when necessary, and with care.
If you encounter a problem or regression:
First, consult the .md log to review previous attempts, decisions, and working solutions.
Attempt to resolve the issue by analyzing past context and making targeted corrections.
Only if this fails, use Git to revert to a previous known-working version of the codebase.
```

### Response:
Setting up new project infrastructure in `/home/afaiyad/borgstore/Doped_MoS2_density/`:

1. **Created SESSION_LOG.md** - This file will serve as our persistent memory and documentation
2. **Initializing Git repository** - For version control and milestone tracking
3. **Setting up basic project structure** - Ready for development

### Actions Taken:
- Created session log file for tracking all interactions and progress
- About to initialize Git repository for version control
- Folder was empty, starting completely fresh

### Additional Setup Completed:
- Created README.md with project overview and structure
- Set up basic directory structure:
  - `src/` for source code
  - `data/` for input files and structures  
  - `results/` for output and analysis
  - `scripts/` for utility scripts
- Initialized Git repository with initial commit

### Status: 
✅ **COMPLETED** - Project infrastructure setup complete

### Next Steps:
- Awaiting specific requirements for the doped MoS2 density analysis
- Ready to implement computational tools and analysis scripts
